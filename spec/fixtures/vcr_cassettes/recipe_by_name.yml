        and rinse the dried kidney beans.. then cover with water in a deep bowl. Remember
        as they soak they will expand to at least triple the size they were originally
        so add a lot of water to the bowl. Soak them overnight or for at least 2 hrs
        to make the cooking step go quicker. I tossed out the water they were soaked
        in after it did the job.\r\n\r\nHave your butcher cut the salted pigtail into
        2 inch pieces as it will be very difficult to cut with an ordinary kitchen
        knife. Wash, then place a deep pot with water and bring to a boil. Cook for
        20 minutes, then drain + rinse and repeat (boil again in water). The goal
        is to make the pieces of pig tails tender and to remove most of the salt it
        was cured in.\r\n\r\nTime to start the soup. Place everything in the pot (except
        the flour and potato), then cover with water and place on a high flame to
        bring to a boil. As it comes to a boil, skim off any scum\/froth at the top
        and discard. Reduce the heat to a gentle boil and allow it to cook for 1 hr
        and 15 mins.. basically until the beans are tender and start falling apart.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
        now time to add the potato (and Yams etc if you\u2019re adding it) as well
        as the coconut milk and continue cooking for 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nNow is a good
        time to start making the basic dough for the spinner dumplings. Mix the flour
        and water (add a pinch of salt if you want) until you have a soft\/smooth
        dough. allow it to rest for 5 minutes, then pinch of a tablespoon at a time
        and roll between your hands to form a cigarette shape.\r\n\r\nAdd them to
        the pot, stir well and continue cooking for another 15 minutes on a rolling
        boil.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll notice that I didn\u2019t add any salt to the pot
        as the remaining salt from the salted pigtails will be enough to properly
        season this dish. However you can taste and adjust accordingly. Lets recap
        the timing part of things so you\u2019re not confused. Cook the base of the
        soup for 1 hr and 15 minute or until tender, then add the potatoes and cook
        for 15 minutes, then add the dumplings and cook for a further 15 minutes.
        Keep in mind that this soup will thicken quite a bit as it cools.\r\n\r\nWhile
        this is not a traditional recipe to any one specific island, versions of this
        soup (sometimes called stewed peas) can be found throughout the Caribbean,
        Latin America and Africa. A hearty bowl of this soup will surely give you
        the sleepies (some may call it ethnic fatigue). You can certainly freeze the
        leftovers and heat it up another day.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/sqpqtp1515365614.jpg","strTags":"Soup,SideDish","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1ogCfDXotMw","strIngredient1":"Kidney

        chicken with rice & peas","strDrinkAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Chicken","strArea":"Jamaican","strInstructions":"To
        make the jerk marinade, combine all the ingredients in a food processor along
        with 1 tsp salt, and blend to a pur\u00e9e. If you\u2019re having trouble
        getting it to blend, just keep turning off the blender, stirring the mixture,
        and trying again. Eventually it will start to blend up \u2013 don\u2019t be
        tempted to add water, as you want a thick paste.\r\n\r\nTaste the jerk mixture
        for seasoning \u2013 it should taste pretty salty, but not unpleasantly, puckering
        salty. You can now throw in more chillies if it\u2019s not spicy enough for
        you. If it tastes too salty and sour, try adding in a bit more brown sugar
        until the mixture tastes well balanced.\r\n\r\nMake a few slashes in the chicken
        thighs and pour the marinade over the meat, rubbing it into all the crevices.
        Cover and leave to marinate overnight in the fridge.\r\n\r\nIf you want to
        barbecue your chicken, get the coals burning 1 hr or so before you\u2019re
        ready to cook. Authentic jerked meats are not exactly grilled as we think
        of grilling, but sort of smoke-grilled. To get a more authentic jerk experience,
        add some wood chips to your barbecue, and cook your chicken over slow, indirect
        heat for 30 mins. To cook in the oven, heat to 180C\/160C fan\/gas 4. Put
        the chicken pieces in a roasting tin with the lime halves and cook for 45
        mins until tender and cooked through.\r\n\r\nWhile the chicken is cooking,
        prepare the rice & peas. Rinse the rice in plenty of cold water, then tip
        it into a large saucepan with all the remaining ingredients except the kidney
        beans. Season with salt, add 300ml cold water and set over a high heat. Once
        the rice begins to boil, turn it down to a medium heat, cover and cook for
        10 mins.\r\n\r\nAdd the beans to the rice, then cover with a lid. Leave off
        the heat for 5 mins until all the liquid is absorbed. Squeeze the roasted
        lime over the chicken and serve with the rice & peas, and some hot sauce if
        you like it really spicy.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/tytyxu1515363282.jpg","strTags":"Chilli,Curry","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qfchrS2D_v4","strIngredient1":"Chicken

        the oil in a 12-inch skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add the eggplants
        and lower the heat to medium. Season with salt and pepper as you rotate the
        eggplants, browning them on all sides. Continue to cook, turning regularly,
        until a fork inserted into the eggplant meets no resistance (you may have
        to stand them up on their fat end to finish cooking the thickest parts), about
        20 minutes, lowering the heat and sprinkling water into the pan as necessary
        if the eggplants threaten to burn or smoke excessively.\r\n\r\n2.\r\nMix the
        harissa, chickpeas and tomatoes together, then add to the eggplants. Cook
        until the tomatoes have blistered and broken down, about 5 minutes more. Season
        with salt and pepper and add water as necessary to thin to a saucy consistency.
        Meanwhile, combine the yogurt and cumin in a serving bowl. Season with salt
        and pepper.\r\n\r\n3.\r\nTop the eggplant mixture with the parsley, drizzle
        with more extra virgin olive oil, and serve with the yogurt on the side.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/yqwtvu1487426027.jpg","strTags":"Vegetarian","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uYB-1xJp4lg","strIngredient1":"Olive
