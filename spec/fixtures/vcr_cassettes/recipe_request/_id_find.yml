        oven to 190C\/170C fan\/gas 5. Tip the flour and sugar into a large bowl.
        Add the butter, then rub into the flour using your fingertips to make a light
        breadcrumb texture. Do not overwork it or the crumble will become heavy. Sprinkle
        the mixture evenly over a baking sheet and bake for 15 mins or until lightly
        coloured.\r\nMeanwhile, for the compote, peel, core and cut the apples into
        2cm dice. Put the butter and sugar in a medium saucepan and melt together
        over a medium heat. Cook for 3 mins until the mixture turns to a light caramel.
        Stir in the apples and cook for 3 mins. Add the blackberries and cinnamon,
        and cook for 3 mins more. Cover, remove from the heat, then leave for 2-3
        mins to continue cooking in the warmth of the pan.\r\nTo serve, spoon the
        warm fruit into an ovenproof gratin dish, top with the crumble mix, then reheat
        in the oven for 5-10 mins. Serve with vanilla ice cream.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/xvsurr1511719182.jpg","strTags":"Pudding","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4vhcOwVBDO4","strIngredient1":"Plain
