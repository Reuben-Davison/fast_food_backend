        the ground meat in a bowl. Chop the onion very finely and grate the garlic
        cloves. Add to the bowl. Add the chopped parsley, all sorts of paprika, baking
        soda, dried breadcrumbs, water, Vegeta, salt, and pepper.\r\nMix well with
        the hand mixer fitted with the dough hooks. Cover the bowl with cling film\/
        plastic foil and leave to rest for 1 or 2 hours in the refrigerator.\r\nTake
        portions of the meat mixture, about 50-55 g\/ 1.7-1.9 oz\/ \u00bc cup portions,
        and form the cevapi. The rolls should be about as thick as your thumb and
        about 7-10 cm\/ 3-4 inches long. I had 18 sausages. The recipe can be easily
        doubled.\r\nGrill the cevapcici on the hot grill pan or on the barbecue for
        about 12-14 minutes, turning them several times in between, or until brown
        and cooked through. I checked by cutting one in the middle and then grilling
        the following batches for the same period of time.\r\nServe hot as suggested
        above. The cevapcici can be reheated in the oven at 180 degrees Celsius\/
        350 degrees Fahrenheit for about 10 minutes or until heated through. Check
        one, if it is not hot enough, give the sausages a few more minutes.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/vc08jn1628769553.jpg","strTags":"Sausages","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_MpSxSgS7f8","strIngredient1":"Minced
