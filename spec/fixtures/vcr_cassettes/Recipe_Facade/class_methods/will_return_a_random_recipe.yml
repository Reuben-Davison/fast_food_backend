        the oven to 180\u00b0C\/Gas mark 4. Have the chicken joints ready to cook.
        Heat the butter and 3 tbsp olive oil in a flameproof casserole or large frying
        pan. Brown the chicken pieces in batches on both sides, seasoning them with
        salt and pepper as you go. Don''t crowd the pan - fry the chicken in small
        batches, removing the pieces to kitchen paper as they are done.\r\n\r\nAdd
        a little more olive oil to the casserole and fry the onions over a medium
        heat for 10 minutes, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned.
        Add the rest of the oil, then the peppers and cook for another 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nAdd
        the chorizo, sun-dried tomatoes and garlic and cook for 2-3 minutes. Add the
        rice, stirring to ensure it is well coated in the oil. Stir in the tomato
        paste, paprika, bay leaves and chopped thyme. Pour in the stock and wine.
        When the liquid starts to bubble, turn the heat down to a gentle simmer. Press
        the rice down into the liquid if it isn''t already submerged and place the
        chicken on top. Add the lemon wedges and olives around the chicken.\r\n\r\nCover
        and cook in the oven for 50 minutes. The rice should be cooked but still have
        some bite, and the chicken should have juices that run clear when pierced
        in the thickest part with a knife. If not, cook for another 5 minutes and
        check again.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wruvqv1511880994.jpg","strTags":"Meat","strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=emfm6TwsVhg","strIngredient1":"Chicken","strIngredient2":"Butter","strIngredient3":"Olive
